Walmart provided data to Kaggle data scientists to help Walmart solve their business problem. In this particular case, Walmart provided data for several years, based on which a model can be used to predict its future sales. This model can be very valuable because it leads to a better understanding of their business. In this project, in order to predict the sale of products on certain days of the year, two models are used, XBGoost and RandomForestRegressor. Then the results of the parameters were calculated and submitted to Kaggle. 
Comparing the obtained results have shown that Random Forest Regressor is better than XGBoost for this problem.
The score Kaggle for XGBoost is 4612.78881 and for RandomForestRegressor is 3048.03191
